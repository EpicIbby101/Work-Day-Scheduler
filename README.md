# Work Day Scheduler
This app is designed to allow users to schedule their work day by the hour, like a to-do list.

I declare that all of my work is my own.

## Features

- Displays the current day at the top of the calender when a user opens the planner.
- Color-code each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed.
- Allow a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock.
Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.
- Persist events between refreshes of a page.
